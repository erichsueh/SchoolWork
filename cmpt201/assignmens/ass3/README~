My program, reads and input file and then does the commands based on what was called:
in the Comment lines, it just prints the comment back to stdoutput
If image, it creates a structure,stores the structure in an object array for later use
If draw, then it accesses the correct structure and then sends the coordinates to sketchpad for processing
if print, it accesses the correct structure and prints out the coordinates
if translate, it adds 10 onto each and every coordinate
if rotate, rotates the program
if child, it removes the child and then echo's the rest of the command into the sketchpad

type make in order to compile the program
and then type ./draw1b ./inputfile.x
where x can be from 1 to 8 in order to send the contents of the inputfile into the sketchpad

All of the code was taken from the slides, the man pages, as well as the labs
