Compile by typing make.

Ensure an executable sketchpad.jar in the current directory, and run by
typing

./parse ./input_file shiftX shiftY

where input_file is a text file containg valid input for parse.c, and 
shiftX and shiftY are the shifts on the X and Y axes.

I did not collaborate with anyone.
