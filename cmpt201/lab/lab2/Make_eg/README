Sample Assignment 1 code.  Only similar in file structure, and, when
run with online input file, on output produced to sketchpad.

draw0.c and draw0.h code are incorrect.
Called draw0 instead of draw1.

Compile by typing make.

Run by typing ./draw0 ./inputfile.1

Note, as this is just an example, the input file in this case doesn't
matter; it will always produce the same output.

When coding, for example for your Assignment 1, you must ensure your
code properly uses the specified input file.
